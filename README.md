# Delphi FPS

This is a very simple game, FPS style, just to test some interesting features of 3D development

(Iknow i shouldn't put an exe on the repo, but it's for the purpouse that you can test it without having to install Delphi and GLScene ðŸ˜‰)

## Requirements

* Delphi 5 +
* GLScene
* OpenGL
